## matrix-registration

a simple python application to have a token based matrix registration

if you like me encountered the situation where you wanted to invite your friends to your homeserver, but neither wanted to open up public registration nor create accounts for every individual user this project should be your solution.

with this project you can just quickly generate tokens and share tthem with your friends to allow them to register to your hs.

### Examples

To try the project out you can play around with the [demo page](/demo.html) for an implemented example page using the demo api or

perform a [curl](https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration/wiki/curl) against the demo api, e.g.:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: shared_secret demopagesecret" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -D "{'one_time': true, 'ex_date': '24.12.2020'}" \
     http://dmnd.sh/test-token/
```
